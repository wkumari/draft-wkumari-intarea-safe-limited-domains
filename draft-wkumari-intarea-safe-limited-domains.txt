                        Safe(r) Limited Domains
           draft-wkumari-intarea-safe-limited-domains-latest

Abstract

   There is a trend towards documents describing protocols that are only
   intended to be used within "limited domains".  These documents often
   do not clearly define how the boundary of the limited domain is
   implemented and enforced, or require that operators of these limited
   domains //perfectly// add filters at all of the boundary nodes of the
   domain to protect the rest of the global Internet from these
   protocols and vice-versa.

   This document discusses the concepts of "fail-open" versus "fail-
   closed" protocols for limited domains.  It further specifies how to
   use layer-2 protocol identification mechanisms for designing limited
   domain protocols that are safer to deploy.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8799] discusses the concept of "limited domains", provides
   examples of limited domains, as well as Examples of Limited Domain
   Solutions, including Service Function Chaining (SFC [RFC7665] ),
   Segment Routing, "Creative uses of IPv6 features" (including
   Extension headers, e.g., for in situ Operations, Administration, and
   maintenance [RFC9378]).

   In order to provide context, this document will quote extensively
   from [RFC8799], but it is assumed that the reader will actually read
   [RFC8799] in its entirety.

   [RFC8799] Section 3, notes:

      A common argument is that if a protocol is intended for limited
      use, the chances are very high that it will in fact be used (or
      misused) in other scenarios including the so-called open Internet.
      This is undoubtedly true and means that limited use is not an
      excuse for bad design or poor security.  In fact, a limited use
      requirement potentially adds complexity to both the protocol and
      its security design, as discussed later.

   Notably, in [RFC8799] Section 2, states:

      Domain boundaries that are defined administratively (e.g., by
      address filtering rules in routers) are prone to leakage caused by
      human error, especially if the limited domain traffic appears
      otherwise normal to the boundary routers.  In this case, the
      network operator needs to take active steps to protect the
      boundary.  This form of leakage is much less likely if nodes must
      be explicitly configured to handle a given limited-domain
      protocol, for example, by installing a specific protocol handler.

   This document addresses the problem of "leakage" of limited domain
   protocols by providing a mechanism so that nodes must be explicitly
   configured to handle the given limited-domain protocol ("fail-
   closed"), rather than relying on the network operator to take active
   steps to protect the boundary ("fail-open").

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Fail-open versus Fail-closed

   Protocols can be broadly classified as either "fail-open" or "fail-
   closed".  Fail-closed protocols are those that require explicit
   interface or device-wide configuration to enable them to be accepted
   or processed when received on an interface.  A classic example of a
   fail-closed protocol is MPLS ([RFC3031]): In order to allow MPLS to
   transit an interface, the operator must enable the MPLS protocol on
   that interface and on the device itself.  This ensures that outside
   MPLS traffic does not leak in.

   Fail-open protocols are those that require explicit configuration in
   order to ensure that they do not leak out of a domain, for example,
   through the application of filters.  An example of a fail-open
   protocol is SRv6 - in order to ensure that SRv6 traffic does not leak
   out of a network, the operator must explicitly filter this traffic,
   and, in order to ensure that SRv6 traffic does not leak in, the
   operator must explicitly filter SRv6 traffic.

   Fail-open protocols are inherently riskier than fail-closed
   protocols, as they rely on perfect configuration of filters on all
   interfaces at the boundary of a domain, and, if the filters are
   removed for any reason (for example, during troubleshooting), there
   is a risk of inbound or outbound leaks.  In addition, some devices or
   interfaces may have limitations in the size and complexity of filters
   that can be applied, and so adding new filter entries to limit leaks
   of a new protocol may not be possible.

   Fail-closed protocols, on the other hand, do not require any explicit
   filtering.  In order for the protocol to be accepted and processed
   when received on an interface, the operator must explicitly enable
   the protocol on that interface and on the device itself.  In
   addition, there is less risk of operational mistakes, as it does not
   rely on filters that may be limited in number and complexity.
   Finally, fail-closed protocols do not require that operators of
   networks outside of the limited domain implement filters to protect
   their networks from the limited domain traffic.

4.  Making a layer-3 type limited-domain protocol fail-closed

   One way to make a limited-domain protocol fail-closed is to assign it
   a unique layer-2 protocol identifier, usually an EtherType.  This
   mechanism is used by MPLS.  In modern router and hosts, if such a
   protocol identifier is not enabled on an interface, then the Ethernet
   chipset will ignore the frame, and the node will not see or process
   it.  Thus, it is necessary to specifically enable the layer-2
   protocol identifier on all relevant interfaces inside the limited
   domain, and the protocol will be blocked at the domain boundary where
   the protocol has not been so enabled.  This is a simple and effective
   mechanism to ensure that the protocol does not leak out of the
   limited domain if and when an operator makes a mistake in configuring
   filters based on identifiers appearing deeper in the frame such as IP
   addresses or IP protocol or header options.

   This layer-2 protocol identifier technique only works for transport-
   type limited domain protocols (i.e., protocols running at layer 3).
   Higher layer protocols cannot necessarily be protected in this way,
   and so cryptographically enforced mechanisms may need to be used
   instead (e.g., as done used by ANIMA in [RFC8994] and [RFC8995]).

5.  Ethernet Protocol Identification

   Figure 1 shows the general format of Ethernet frames.  The relevant
   protocol identification field occurs after the destination and source
   MAC addresses and any tags (such a VLAN tags).  The alternatives for
   protocol identification are discussed in Section 3 of [RFC9542].

  +-----------+-----------+- - - - +----------+--------- - - -+-------+
  |Destination|  Source   |Optional| Protocol |  Body of      |Trailer|
  |MAC Address|MAC Address|  Tags  |Identifier|   Frame        |       |
  +-----------+-----------+ - - - -+----------+--------- - - -+-------|

                     Figure 1: Ethernet Frame Format

   This document considers EtherType protocol identification.  An
   EtherType is an unsigned 16-bit field in an Ethernet frame with a
   value in the range of 0x0600 to 0xFFFF, and so it is a somewhat
   limited resource; however, there exists a special Extended EtherType
   (0x88B7) that can be suffixed by an Organizationally Unique
   Identifier (OUI) followed by a further 16-bits identifying the
   protocol relative to that OUI as discussed in Section 3 of [RFC9542].
   These alternatives of a direct EtherType or use of the Extended
   EtherType for the case of the IANA OUI are illustrated in Figure 2.
   The following subsections discuss the factors which may influence the
   choice between these alternatives when use of such layer 2 protocol
   identification, to make the isolation of a limited domain more
   robust, is warranted.

             Figure 2: EtherType Based Protocol Identification

   Because specific EtherTypes are a limited resource, an Extended
   EtherType SHOULD be used unless there is a strong reason why it will
   not work satisfactorily and a specific EtherType is required.

5.1.  Extended EtherType Protocol Identification

   The main advantage of using an Extended EtherType with an IANA
   Protocol Number, as shown in Figure 2, is that such a number can be
   allocated by IANA with Expert Review based on an Internet Draft and
   is thus relatively easy to obtain.  The main disadvantage is that the
   protocol identification is 5 bytes longer than a specific dedicated
   EtherType.

5.2.  Specific EtherType Protocol Identification

   The primary disadvantage of using a specific EtherType, as opposed to
   an Extended EtherType, is that assignment of such an EtherType is
   significantly more difficult than assignment of an Extended EtherType
   IANA protocol number.  As discussed in [RFC9542], a specific
   EtherType can only be assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority
   under the following policy: "Since EtherTypes are a fairly scarce
   resource, the IEEE RAC has let us know that they will not assign a
   new EtherType to a new IETF protocol specification until the IESG has
   approved the protocol specification for publication as an RFC.  In
   exceptional cases, the IEEE RA is willing to consider "early
   allocation" of an EtherType for an IETF protocol that is still under
   development as long as the request comes from and has been vetted by
   the IESG."  ([RFC9542] Appendix B.1, citing [IESG_EtherType])

   During development and testing, a protocol can use a "Local
   Experimental Ethertype" (0x88b5 and 0x88b6 - [IANA_EtherType]).  Once
   the protocol is approved for publication, the IESG can request an
   EtherType from the IEEE.  However, there is always a risk of some
   implementation using a Local Experimental EtherType not getting
   updated causing conflicts with a later different use of that
   experimental EtherType.

   The primary advantage of using a specific EtherType is the saving of
   5 bytes relative to the use of the Extended EtherType with a protocol
   number under the IANA OUI.

6.  Security Considerations

   Protocols are designated as "limited domain" because something
   unexpected might happen if they leak outside of a domain with unified
   management.  For example, VLAN or VPN or overlay identifiers may be
   misinterpreted resulting in the delivery of data to or the acceptance
   of data from unauthorized network nodes violating intended security
   constraints.  The use of a layer-2 protocol identifier to provide a
   "fail closed" barrier at the domain border can significantly improve
   security by eliminating the opportunity for such misinterpretation.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
